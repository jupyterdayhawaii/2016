Markdown solves a problem we all have: turning raw text into a well-formatted, easy to read document or web page. It allows you to use a simple text editor to create and edit richly marked-up documents in a very human-friendly syntax, so friendly that once you've been using it for about an hour you will just see the finished document in your mind as you're typing. Combined with Jupyter, Markdown enables you to write rich reports and analysis with embedded Python snippets that result in easy-to-read documents that can be updated with live data changes at the press of a button. In this talk, you will learn the basics of the Markdown language and how to use it for all your document-writing needs.
